Available as a Go package, CLI tool, and Linux service, and with built-in third-party support for tools such as ```Docker```, ```REX-Ray``` is easily integrated into any workflow. For example, here's how to list storage for a guest hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with ```REX-Ray```:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[0]akutz@pax:~$ export REXRAY_STORAGEDRIVERS=ec2\r\n[0]akutz@pax:~$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=access_key\r\n[0]akutz@pax:~$ export AWS_SECRET_KEY=secret_key\r\n[0]akutz@pax:~$ rexray volume get\r\n\r\n- providername: ec2\r\n  instanceid: i-695bb6ab\r\n  volumeid: vol-dedbadc3\r\n  devicename: /dev/sda1\r\n  region: us-west-1\r\n  status: attached\r\n- providername: ec2\r\n  instanceid: i-695bb6ab\r\n  volumeid: vol-04c4b219\r\n  devicename: /dev/xvdb\r\n  region: us-west-1\r\n  status: attached\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Features\r\nToday `REX-Ray` supports the following storage providers:\r\n\r\n* [Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\r\n* [Openstack on Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/en-us/cloud/openstack)\r\n* [ScaleIO](http://www.emc.com/storage/scaleio/index.htm)\r\n* [XtremIO](http://xtremio.com/) (with Multipath & Device Mapper support)\r\n\r\n`REX-Ray` also supports integration with the following platforms:\r\n\r\n* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/extend/plugins_volume/)\r\n\r\n# Operating System Support\r\n`REX-Ray` currently supports the following operating systems:\r\n\r\nOS      | Command Line | As Service\r\n--------|--------------|-----------\r\nLinux   | Yes          | Yes\r\nOS X    | Yes          | No\r\nWindows | No           | No\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nThe following command will download the most recent, stable build of `REX-Ray` and install it to `/usr/bin/rexray.` On Linux systems `REX-Ray` will also be registered as either a SystemD or SystemV service.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -sSL https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/install | sh -\r\n```\r\n\r\n`REX-Ray` can also be installed from [a pre-built binary](https://github.com/emccode/rexray/wiki/Installation#install-a-pre-built-binary), an RPM or DEB package, or by [building it from source](https://github.com/emccode/rexray/wiki/Installation#build-and-install-from-source).\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nOnce installed, `REX-Ray` can be used by simply typing `rexray` on the command line, but in order for `REX-Ray` to do much more than print out help text, configuration is necessary:\r\n\r\n### Configuring REX-Ray\r\n* Environment variables\r\n* Configuration files\r\n* Command line options\r\n* Global configuration options\r\n\r\n### Configuring Storage Providers\r\n* [Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\r\n* [Openstack on Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/en-us/cloud/openstack)\r\n* [ScaleIO](http://www.emc.com/storage/scaleio/index.htm)\r\n* [XtremIO](http://xtremio.com/) (with Multipath & Device Mapper support)\r\n\r\n### Configuring External Integration\r\n* Docker Volume Plugin\r\n\r\n# Contributions\r\nWe are actively looking for contributors to this project.
